## 24 Day advent challenge
by https://twitter.com/goncy. 
every day is a blank slate, what was done in the previous day is deleted. start from 0 and add a new feature every day.

some of the first days were too simple to upload haha. 
the main focus on this was to learn as much as possible from this, and I learned a ton. 
on the last uploaded day I decided i wanted to learn more about apis/fetching so I went to do that!

some things it uses: useReducer, useEffect, useState, the js fundamentals like map, filter, reduce, and a lot more!
depending on the day it can have more or it can have less since the objective on each day changes.

you can see the progession each day see the branches for the different days, it's pretty cool hehe
